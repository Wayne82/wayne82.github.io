After completing my initial exploration and study of neural networks — and documenting it in [Neural Network Notes: the Basics and Backpropagation](https://wayne82.github.io/neural-network/2025/03/30/Neural-Network-Notes-The-Basics-and-Backpropagation.html) — I am now moving on to the next fascinating topic: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are a type of deep learning architecture specifically designed to process data with a grid-like structure, such as images. They excel at tasks like image recognition and classification, and have remained a cornerstone of computer vision and deep learning to this day.

Thanks to the open internet, I was able to access a world-class course — [CS231n: Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://cs231n.github.io/) — from a top university. After spending about two weeks studying eagerly during my evenings, I completed the course. As usual, I would like to document my notes and experiences in this blog.
