Until now, I am quite happy with the progress of my neural network learning journey. I have covered the [basics of neural networks](https://wayne82.github.io/neural-network/2025/03/30/Neural-Network-Notes-The-Basics-and-Backpropagation.html), [convolutional neural networks](https://wayne82.github.io/neural-network/2025/05/15/Neural-Network-Notes-Convolutional-Neural-Network.html), and also get my hands on coding the [vanilla neural network](https://wayne82.github.io/neural-network/2025/06/01/Neural-Network-Notes-Coding-the-Network-from-Scratch.html) and [convolutional neural network](https://wayne82.github.io/neural-network/2025/07/12/Neural-Network-Notes-Coding-CNN.html) from "scratch". Now, it is time to dive into another innovative architecture: **recurrent neural networks** (RNNs), a type of artificial neural network designed to process sequential data, where the order of elements is crucial, like text or time series.
