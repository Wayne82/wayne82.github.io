It's been several years since I first encountered the Gimbal Lock problem, and back then, I didn't quite grasp its underlying mechanics. However, after revisiting the issue more recently, I believe Iâ€™ve finally cracked the parts that had confused me for so long. In this blog, I want to share my understanding of Gimbal Lock and how it affects systems like computer graphics.

## What is Gimbal Lock?

## A Mathematical Perspective on Gimbal Lock

## Real World Implications of Gimbal Lock
- **Computer Graphics**
- **Others**

## The Key Concepts
- **Euler angles** (geometrical definition, proper and Tait-Bryan angles)
- **Frame of reference** (handedness)
- **Active and passive** transformation
- **Rotation Matrix** 

  apply to active rotations of vectors counterclockwise in a right-handed coordinate system (y counterclockwise from x) by pre-multiplication (R on the left) of the column vectors.

- **Intrinsic and Extrinsic Rotations**
