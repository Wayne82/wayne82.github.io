Continuing from what I've left off in my [previous post](https://wayne82.github.io/mathematics/2025/09/20/Learn-Linear-Algebra-Notes-on-Key-Definitions.html), I will proceed with my learning notes on key definitions in the remaining chapters of [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://linear.axler.net/LADR4e.pdf) by Sheldon Axler.

## The Key Definitions (Chapter 5~7)
Chapter 4 is about polynomials that will be needed to understand linear operators in later chapters, but containing no linear algebra, so I will skip it here.

### Chapter 5: Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors, and Invariant Subspaces
### Chapter 6: Inner Product Spaces
### Chapter 7: Operators on Inner Product Spaces
