It's been a while since my last post about neural networks, which covers certain mathematical details, to my own interest. As originally planned, my next learning topic is attention mechanism and transformers. However, the book of "Linear Algebra Done Right" by Sheldon Axler lying on the table for quite a while caught my attention eventually. And one day, I can't help picking it up and start reading. Until now, I have read the first 7 chapters, and find it is quite a fresh way to learn linear algebra for someone like me who only learned it in college as a general course 2 decades ago. There are 2 more chapters to go, but I think it is good for me to stop at this point and write down some notes about what I have learned so far.
